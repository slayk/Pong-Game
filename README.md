# Pong Game

A two-player ping pong game made using Turtle and Time modules.

- The code is divided ito 3 classes - ball, score, and ping.
- The ball is at the middle of the screen at first and starts moving towards the right player once the screen is clicked.
- Then, once the right player gets hold of it, it bounces to the second player on the left.
- The game continues in this manner until one of the player misses the ball.
- If any player misses the ball, the opponent's score increase by 1. 
- With every round, the speed of the ball keeps increasing.
- The movement of the right player is based on the "up" and "down" keys.
- The movement of the left player is based on the "w" and "s" keys.

Hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed making it.
